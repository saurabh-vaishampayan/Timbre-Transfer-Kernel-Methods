This contains code for project on performing timbre transfer on musical instruments using kernel methods.
The aim is to first use some form of disentangling of time invariant and variant features of audio, perform style transfer,
and train a kernel model to perform timbre transfer in real time
For disentangling time invariant and time variant features of audio, we will be implementing a modification of Disentangled Sequential Autoencoder(Yinghzen Li, Stephen Mandt)(link:https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02991)
